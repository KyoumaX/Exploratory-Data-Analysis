# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

1. Obtained Titanic dataset from Kaggle
2. Performed preliminary cleaning and preprocessing
3. Removed redundant columns, and changed datatypes to match the entries
4. Generated a heatmap for correlation between all fields in cleaned dataset
5. Plotted correlation of every field in the dataframe with 'survived' (except itself)
6. Plotted regression lines to identify variation trends in 'survived' wrt 'fare', 'passenger_id', 'sex', 'p_class', 'embarked'
7. Calculated skewness of every field in the cleaned dataset
8. Created a PDF report recording detailed observations
